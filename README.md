# page-inspector-overlay

Our web application is a powerful webpage inspector overlay designed to assist users in analyzing and labeling various sections and elements of a webpage's html content. 

1. Navigation and Layout:
Header: The top section of the application houses a header containing the application logo and navigation links for different sections of the app.
Sidebar: A collapsible sidebar on the left provides easy access to various tools and features, including labeling, categorizing, and listing labeled elements.
Main Content Area: The central portion of the UI is dedicated to displaying the webpage being inspected along with overlaid highlighting and labeling functionalities.
2. Inspection and Labeling:
Highlighting: Users can interact with the webpage directly by hovering over different sections or elements. Upon hovering, elements are highlighted with a distinct border or background color, providing visual feedback.
Context Menu: Right-clicking on a highlighted element brings up a context menu with options to label, categorize, or perform other actions on the selected element.
Labeling Form: Clicking on the label option in the context menu opens a form where users can enter labels for the selected element. The form includes input fields for adding labels and buttons for saving or canceling the labeling action.
Category Selection: For categorizing elements, users can choose from predefined categories displayed in a dropdown menu within the labeling form.
